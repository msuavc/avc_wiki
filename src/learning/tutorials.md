# Tutorials

Below are a bunch of online resources for further learning about the software we use on a daily basis.

## UNIX/Linux
- [UNIX/Linux Tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
    - This UNIX/Linux tutorial will cover all the basics of UNIX/Linux based operating systems, how to use command-line tools,
    and much much more. If you are not comfortable in a terminal environment or have not used Linux before, definitely 
    check this tutorial out.

## ROS
- [ROS Tutorial Project](https://gitlab.msu.edu/canvas/soar/public/ros-tutorial-project)
    - The ROS Tutorial Project was created to get our members familiar with the specifics of AVC's development environment.
    It's recommended that you start here, as it closely mimics the actual environment the club will have you develop in.
- [Official ROS Tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)
    - The developers of ROS created their own tutorials for ROS, and they go into more detail regarding all the components ROS
    has to offer. You can use the docker image from the ROS Tutorial Project above, and skip the "Installing and Configuring 
    Your ROS Environment" as the ROS Tutorial Project already covers that.
- [Clearpath Robotics Tutorial](http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/ros/)
    - A company called Clearpath robotics has created a tutorial to go along with a ground vehicle robot they developed, and 
    in this tutorial you're able to simulate this robot. This requires the setup of a VM, but it provides a more visual way to
    interact with ROS
## Python
- [Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
    - The developers of python created this tutorial to comprehensively introduce you to Python. Be warned, it is very wordy 
    not super interactive.
