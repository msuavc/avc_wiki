This aims to serve as a single source of truth for all
AVC software, hardware, and other content.

## Software Stack

For more information on,:
[!ref Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/)
[!ref Python](https://www.python.org/)
[!ref C++](https://cplusplus.com/)
[!ref Git](https://git-scm.com/)
[!ref Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Since we have our own configuration for everything, we have written guides for your
convenience. You'll probably want to start with the basics:
[!ref text="ROS Basics" icon="hubot"](~/learning/ros-basics)
[!ref text="Git Basics" icon="git-commit"](~/learning/git-basics)

After reading the basics sections, you can follow some
[tutorials](~/learning/tutorials) that will give you hands on experience.
From there, talk to your team leads or project leads to get started with development.

## Development

For those who are developing, refer to the workflow section for repeatable steps to
guide you:

[!ref text="Branching and Merging" icon="git-branch"](~/workflow/branching-and-merging)
[!ref text="Creating ROS Packages" icon="file-directory"](~/workflow/package-creation)
[!ref text="Creating ROS Nodes with Python" icon="note"](~/workflow/node-creation)
!!!info C++
Creating ROS Nodes with C++ is coming soon.

## Hardware Resources

AVC has multiple [servers](~/devops/avc-compute) for you to connect to while developing.

To access them, first ask a lead about requesting VPN access from DECS. Then,
[set up the VPN](~/devops/vpn-configuration). You can also access a
[virtual desktop](~/devops/turbo-vnc) to develop in.
