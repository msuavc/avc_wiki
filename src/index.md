# Welcome

Welcome to the AVC Wiki! This aims to serve as a single source of truth for all AVC software, hardware, and other content.

## New Members

If you're new to the club and our software, you'll probably want to start with the basics! AVC's
software stack is composed of:
[!ref Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/)
[!ref Python](https://www.python.org/)
[!ref C++](https://cplusplus.com/)
[!ref Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Since we have our own configuration for everything, we have written guides for your
convenience. You'll probably want to start with the basics:
[!ref text="ROS Basics" icon="hubot"](~/learning/ros-basics)
[!ref text="Git Basics" icon="git-commit"](~/learning/git-basics)

After reading the basics sections, you can follow some [tutorials](~/learning/tutorials) that will give you hands on experience. From there, talk to your team leads or project leads to get started with development.

## Developing Members

For developers, the workflow section is there to guide you as you develop ROS software for the vehicle:
